%=======================02-713 LaTeX template, following the 15-210 template==================
%
% You don't need to use LaTeX or this template, but you must turn your homework in as
% a typeset PDF somehow.
%
% How to use:
%    1. Update your information in section "A" below
%    2. Write your answers in section "B" below. Precede answers for all 
%       parts of a question with the command "\question{n}{desc}" where n is
%       the question number and "desc" is a short, one-line description of 
%       the problem. There is no need to restate the problem.
%    3. If a question has multiple parts, precede the answer to part x with the
%       command "\part{x}".
%    4. If a problem asks you to design an algorithm, use the commands
%       \algorithm, \correctness, \runtime to precede your discussion of the 
%       description of the algorithm, its correctness, and its running time, respectively.
%    5. You can include graphics by using the command \includegraphics{FILENAME}

% no need to restate the problem --- the graders know which problem is which,
% but replacing "The First Problem" with a short phrase will help you remember
% which problem this is when you read over your homeworks to study.

\question{2.6.2} {A coded message from a CIA operative to his Russian KGB counterpart
is to be sent in the form Q4ET, where the first and last entries must be consonants;
the second, an integer 1 through 9; and the third, one of the 6 vowels. How many
different ciphers can be transmitted?}\\
20*9*6*20=21600

\question{2.6.6}{A fast-food restaurant offers customers a choice of eight
toppings that can be added to a hamburger. How many hamburgers can be ordered?}\\
You can order a hamburger with anywhere between 0 and 8 toppings:
$
\binom{8}{0}+
\binom{8}{1}+
\binom{8}{2}+
\binom{8}{3}+
\binom{8}{4}+
\binom{8}{5}+
\binom{8}{6}+
\binom{8}{7}+
\binom{8}{8}
$ \\
$
\frac{8!}{0!8!} + 
\frac{8!}{1!7!} + 
\frac{8!}{2!6!} + 
\frac{8!}{3!5!} + 
\frac{8!}{4!4!} + 
\frac{8!}{5!3!} + 
\frac{8!}{6!2!} + 
\frac{8!}{7!1!} + 
\frac{8!}{8!0!}
$
$\\ 
1 + 8 + 28 + 56 + 70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 256
$ \\

\question{2.6.26}{A new horror movie,\emph{Friday the 13th, Part X}, will star
    Jason's great-grandson (also named Jason) as a psychotic trying to dispatch
(as gruesomely as possible) eight camp counselors, four men and four women.}
\\ \part{a}{How many scenarios (i.e., victim orers) can the screenwriters devise,
assuming they want Jason to do away with all the men before going after any of the
women?} \\
$4!*4!=576$
\\ \part{b}{How many scripts are possible if the only restriction imposed on Jason
is that he save Muffy for last?} \\
$7!=5040$

\question{2.6.38}{How many ways can the letters in the word \\
\emph{SLUMGULLION} \\
be arranged so that the three L's precede all other consonants?}\\
$
\frac{11!}{4!3!4!} + 
\frac{11!}{3!3!5!} + 
\frac{11!}{2!3!6!} + 
\frac{11!}{1!3!7!} + 
\frac{11!}{3!8!}
=
11550 + 9240 + 4620 + 1320 + 165 = 26895
$


\question{2.6.52}{A boat has a crew of eight: Two of those eight can row only
on the stroke side, while three can row only on the bow side. In how may ways
can the two sides of the boat be manned?}\\
Of the remaining 3 crew members, they can be distributed on either side
in $\frac{3!}{2!1!}=3$ ways. \\
Each side can be manned $ 4! $ ways. \\
There are a total of $3*4!*4! = 1728$ ways to man the boat.

\question{2.7.2}{An urn contains six chips, numbered 1 through 6. Two are chosen
at random and their numbers are added together. What is the probability that the
resulting sum is equal to 5?}\\
$
S = \{
(1,4)
(2,3)
(3,2)
(4,1)
\}
$
\\
$\frac{N (S)}{_{6}P_{2}} = \frac{4}{\frac{6!}{4!}} = \frac{4}{30} = 0.1\overline{3}$


\question{2.7.12}{If the letters in the phrase \\
\emph{A ROLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS} \\
are arranged at random, what are the chances that not all the S's will be adjacent?}\\
If we consider \emph{SSSS} as a single letter, then the phrase has only $ (25-4+1)$ letters:
\\
$
1 - \frac{4!(25-4+1)!}{25!} = 
1 - \frac{4!22!}{25!} = 
1 - \frac{1}{25*23} =
1 - 0.00174 = 0.99826
$



\question{3.2.2}{In a nuclear reactor, the fission process is controlled by 
inserting special rods into the radioactive core to absorb neutrons and slow
down the nuclear chain rection. When functioning properly, these rods serve
as a first-line defense against a core meltdown. Suppose a reactor has ten 
control rods, each operating independently and each having an 0.80 probability
of being properly inserted in the event of an `incident.` Furthermore, suppose
that a meltdown will be prevented if at least half the rods perform satisfactorily.
What is the probability that, upon demand, the system will fail?}\\
$\sum_{6}^{10} \binom{10}{n}(0.8)^{10-n} (0.2)^{n} = \\
\binom{10}{6}(0.8)^{4} (0.2)^{6} + 
\binom{10}{7}(0.8)^{3} (0.2)^{7} + 
\binom{10}{8}(0.8)^{2} (0.2)^{8} + 
\binom{10}{9}(0.8)^{1} (0.2)^{9} + 
\binom{10}{10}(0.8)^{0} (0.2)^{10} = \\
0.006369
$


\question{3.2.14}{The captain of a Navy gunboat orders a volley of twenty-five
missiles to be fired at random along a five-hundred-foot stretch of shoreline that
he hopes to establish as a beachhead. Dug into the beach is a thirty-foot-long
bunker serving as the enemy's first line of defense. The captain has reason to
believe that the bunker will be destroyed if at least three of the missles are
on-target. What is the probability of that happening?} \\
$\sum_{3}^{25}\binom{25}{n}(\frac{30}{500})^{n} (\frac{470}{500})^{25-n} =
1-\sum_{0}^{2}\binom{25}{n}(\frac{30}{500})^{n} (\frac{470}{500})^{25-n}$ 
\\ .\\
$ 1- (
\binom{25}{0} (0.06)^{0} * (0.94)^{25} +
\binom{25}{1} (0.06)^{1} * (0.94)^{24} +
\binom{25}{2} (0.06)^{2} * (0.94)^{23})
= 1 - 0.8129 = 0.1871
$

\question{3.2.20}{A corporate board contains twelve members. The board decides
to create a five-person Committee to Hide Corporate Debt. Suppose four members
of the board are accountants. What is the probability that the Committee will
contain two accountants and three nonaccountants?}\\
$\frac{\binom{4}{2} \binom{8}{3}}{\binom{12}{5}} = 
\frac{6*56}{792} = 0.\overline{42}$

\question{Simulation}{Consider a Baseball World Series (best of 7 game series) in which team A theoretically
    has a 0.55 chance of winning each game against team B. Simulate the probability that team A
    would win a World Series against team B by simulating 1000 World Series. You many use any
software to conduct the simulation. }
